1. In these weeks, I have learned the basic syntax and basic concepts of python,
   through continuous exercises after class, I understand how to complete my code.
2. I often replay the recording of the course. At the same time,
   I also watch some teaching videos related to python on YouTube
   and ask the teacher in time if I have any questions.
3. I need to run the code over and over again to see what went wrong
   before I finished the code until it was running properly
   without any errors or bugs.
