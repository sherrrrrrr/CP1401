   allow modifications or writing to the file.
   The 'w' mode is used for opening a file in write mode.
   It will create a new file if it doesn't exist or overwrite
   the existing file. It allows you to write content to the file
   but does not support reading.
2. A file object is a Python object that represents a file opened by
   the `open()` function. It provides methods and attributes to perform
   various operations on the file. A file name is simply a string that
   represents the name or path of a file in the file system. The file's
   contents refer to the actual data stored in the file.
3. It is necessary to close a file after it has been opened and used to

5. print(filename)
6. 5-10 question is a good number of quick question.

Logic Exercise
1. If you assume that there is exactly one false statement in the list,
   then the first statement would be false, which contradicts the assumption.
2. If you assume that there are exactly two false statements in the list,
   then the second statement would be false, which contradicts the assumption.
3. If you assume that there are exactly three false statements in the list,
   then the third statement would be false, which contradicts the assumption.
Conclusionï¼šThere is no consistent solution to this paradox,
   it is not possible to determine the number of false statements in the list.
